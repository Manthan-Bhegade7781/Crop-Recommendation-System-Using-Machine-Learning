# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System: Your Smart Agriculture Companion 

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Crop Recommendation System** is a smart farming tool that leverages machine learning to help farmers choose the best crops to cultivate based on soil and environmental conditions. Using key parameters like **Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH**, and **Rainfall**, the system provides precise crop suggestions.

With a clean interface and real-time analysis, this system improves decision-making, increases crop yield, and promotes sustainable farming practices. The model is built using advanced algorithms, with **Random Forest achieving 99.55% accuracy**.

| Feature       | Description                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| `N`           | Nitrogen content in soil            |
| `P`           | Phosphorus content in soil          |
| `K`           | Potassium content in soil           |
| `Temperature` | Temperature in degrees Celsius      |
| `Humidity`    | Relative humidity in percentage     |
| `pH`          | pH value of the soil                |
| `Rainfall`    | Rainfall in mm                      |
| `Label`       | Crop type (Target variable)         |

This labeled data helps the machine learning model learn patterns to recommend crops based on environmental factors.
